# City-Lights Quote & Invoice Management System
A lightweight internal application was developed for **City-Lights**, a small electrical services startup, to streamline the creation of **client quotes and invoices**.

This system enables staff to quickly generate professional PDF documents, store them in a database, and retrieve past records through an easy-to-use web interface.
The system is currently under active development, with additional features planned.

---

## Overview

Small service businesses often rely on spreadsheets or manual paperwork to create quotes and invoices.
This system digitizes that workflow for **City-Lights**, improving efficiency, consistency, and record management.

The application is built with **FastAPI and PostgreSQL** and provides a simple web interface for generating and managing documents.

## Current Features

* Create **client quotes**
* Create **client invoices**
* Generate **PDF documents automatically**
* Store quote and invoice records in a **PostgreSQL database**
* Retrieve document history
* Search for previously generated documents
* Simple **web interface for staff use**
